## Energy Landscapes with Expectation Reflection
This directory is dedicated to showing how Expectation Reflection can be used to generate energy landscapes for groups of sequences (contours of iso-energy or likelihood from specific sequence background)
## Sequences Groups
* Line 1
  * Generating energy landscapes for sequence group from previous work -- https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008991
  * This group can be run as-is from the directory and requires no significant computational power
* HIV-Envelope
  * The analysis on this group is incomplete.
  * This is the analysis for the OAR Innovation grant.
  * Data obtained from https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/NEWALIGN/align.html ( see jupyter notebook for details on filters/processing)

* SARS CoV-2 Spike Protein
  * This group requires running batch and swarm scripts on biowulf.
